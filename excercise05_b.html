                It's been a long day without you, my friend<br />
                And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again<br />
                We've come a long way from where we began<br />

                All the planes we flew, good things we been through<br />
                That I'd be standing right here talking to you<br />
                'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh<br />
                But something told me that it wouldn't last<br />
                Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture<br />
                Those were the days, hard work forever pays<br />
                Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)<br />
